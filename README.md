As part of my internship at CodTech IT Solutions, I developed a web-based project titled "Anime Recommendation System", which combines machine learning logic with an interactive and user-friendly website interface. The goal was to help users discover anime titles based on genres they enjoy, such as Action, Fantasy, Romance, Comedy, and more.

The project was built using Python for the backend logic, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript used to create a visually appealing and responsive user interface. The system allows users to select an anime genre from a dropdown or button and receive personalized recommendations from a predefined dataset.

1. Dataset and Genre Mapping
The recommendation engine was built using a cleaned anime dataset in CSV format. The dataset contains fields such as anime name, genre, and rating. For simplicity, each anime entry is associated with a list of genres.

The logic behind the recommendations is based on content filtering, where anime are suggested according to the genres selected by the user. If a user selects a genre like "Action", the system filters the dataset and shows the top anime entries tagged with that genre.

2. Backend with Python
The backend logic was written in Python. The script reads the dataset, filters it based on the genre input, and then returns a list of recommended anime. Recommendations are printed dynamically and passed to the frontend for display. This logic ensures that the website gives meaningful, real-time recommendations without the need for external APIs or complex machine learning models.

3. Frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
A key highlight of this project is the simple and attractive UI, which makes the website pleasant and intuitive for users. Key UI features include:

Genre Buttons or Dropdowns: Users can select from a list of genres (e.g., Fantasy, Isekai, Romance) through clearly styled buttons or dropdowns.

Background Image: The site includes a soft, anime-themed background to create a friendly and immersive aesthetic.

Recommendation Display: Anime suggestions are displayed dynamically below the selection area with well-styled cards or text blocks, using elegant fonts and proper spacing.

Responsive Design: The layout is responsive, making it usable on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

CSS was used extensively to improve font styles, layout design, button coloring, and overall site appearance. The result is a clean and professional look while remaining easy for new users to navigate.

4. Workflow
User visits the website.

Selects a genre (e.g., “Romance”).

The backend receives the selected genre, filters the dataset, and returns a list of matching anime.

The frontend dynamically updates to display the recommended anime titles.

Summary of Tasks Completed:
Created and cleaned an anime dataset for use in recommendations.

Implemented content-based filtering using Python.

Built the backend logic to read genre input and return results.

Designed a modern, responsive, and attractive frontend using HTML and CSS.

Integrated backend and frontend for full-stack functionality.

Tested the site for usability and recommendation accuracy.

This project helped me apply both web development and basic machine learning principles to a real-world use case. It also improved my skills in integrating frontend and backend components, building user interfaces, and creating systems that are functional, lightweight, and engaging. The Anime Recommendation Website is a great example of how user preferences and clean design can be combined to create a smart and enjoyable user experience.
